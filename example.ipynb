    "## Julia Macros : Learning through use cases\n",

    "If you are reading this, you either didn't read the Julia Meta Programming docs ; or you are a masochist. The docs are correct. Nobody in their right mind should be trying to create macros. They are too difficult. I didn't believe the docs. I **use** macros often. What would life be like without @btime; @match; @test; @kwdef. Their authors must be of sound mind. Surely macros can't be all that bad.\n",
    "\n",
    "I took the plunge. I wrote one. It was easy. The docs lied. I took the plunge again. I almost drowned in crypic errors. The docs are right. Macros are almost impossible. I must be a masochist. I thought if I studdied a few macros I would figure out the patterns and life would be good. I followed the patterns. I stuck random $'s signs and \"esc\" in various places in my macros. Sometimes it even worked. How many missteps would it take to figure out the patterns?\n",

    "### Disclaimer: Reading this is not going to make macros easy\n",
    "\n",
    "Reading this will help you understand why macros are hard. It may encourge you to try harder to find a function that will do a simalar job, or that copy and paste isn't as bad as you thought it was. \n",

    "\n",
    "I am building a DSL for composition. This is a passion project. It's first task the rather challenging task of composing mulutimedia artworks comprising of music and images. I am hoping for a natural and expressive way for the composer to provide input to the composition process. A natural process will make for easy learning and easy iterative revisions. Nothing kills the creative flow more than hunting down coding errors and fighting the syntax to work around them. I know that if I use macros, I have less constraints on the syntax. Given the dire warnings in the docs, I wanted to know how viable it would front my API with macros, hiding most of my functions and resticting the amount of Julia syntax that the composer needs to understand. \n",

    "As technologists, we pride ourselves in what we know. We also pride ourselves in our ability to get stuff done. When our deep knowledge propells us to get stuff done better and faster, these two sources of pride are aligned. However when we favor what we know for expediant results, we actively avoid what we don't know. This is a big deal! It hampers our personal growth. It causes conflict in teams. I could go on..., but instead I will leave you with my abstract metagoal: to find techniques to embrace unknowns; get stuff done ; and make meaningful progress. **Meaningful progress seldom comes from what you know**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### A gentle start\n",
    "\n",
    "Not all macros are hard. When I got lucky with my first one, it wasn't luck. If all you need is a macro that substitutes a variable or two into templated code, you should be ok."
